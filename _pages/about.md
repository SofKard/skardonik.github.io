I'm a PhD student  working under the guidance of Prof. Jeffrey Fessler and Prof. Douglas Noll at the University of Michigan. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin working under the supervision of Prof. Jon Tamir.  My research interests include signal and image processing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computational imaging, inverse problems, and the connections between machine learning and constrained image reconstruction.
